            <p>
                The field of electronics and communication underwent a revolution in the 20th century, particularly with the invention of the transistor in 1947 and the integrated circuit in the 1950s. These developments, guided by electrical engineering, enabled rapid miniaturization and advancement of communication systems. As global demand for instant information and automation grew, engineers designed high-speed data networks, satellite communication systems, and wireless technologies that reshaped modern society. This infrastructure laid the groundwork for the Internet, smartphones, and the smart cities of today.

            <p>
                Tokyo is a global leader in advanced communication infrastructure. The city is equipped with high-speed fiber-optic networks, 5G mobile services, and smart infrastructure systems that rely on real-time data transmission. Companies like NTT and SoftBank have helped transform Tokyo into a hyper-connected urban hub. For instance, Tokyo’s public transportation system utilizes contactless smart cards (like Suica and Pasmo) that depend on RFID and networked communication technologies. In addition, Tokyo’s disaster response systems and surveillance rely heavily on fast communication infrastructure to send alerts, monitor citywide data, and coordinate emergency services.
