        <h2>High Voltage Power Transmission and Distribution background information</h2>

            <p>
                High-voltage power transmission and distribution systems emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a solution to transporting electricity over long distances without significant energy loss. Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse were among the first to demonstrate alternating current (AC) as a more viable method than direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission. Electrical engineers developed transformers to step up voltage for transmission and step it down for safe consumer use. This infrastructure became essential for powering growing cities, industries, and transportation networks.

                Tokyo, as one of the most populous urban centers globally, relies heavily on a robust high-voltage power grid. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) manages a complex network of substations, transformers, and high-voltage lines to distribute electricity to millions of households and businesses. A unique aspect of Japan’s power grid is the coexistence of two different frequencies (50 Hz in Tokyo and 60 Hz in Osaka), requiring special frequency converter stations. During the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and Fukushima disaster, Tokyo's power grid was tested severely, leading to accelerated innovation in smart grid technology and energy storage solutions to improve power resilience and efficiency.
