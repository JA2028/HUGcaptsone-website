                The electric railway system was a groundbreaking innovation that emerged during the late 19th century, transforming urban transportation. Pioneered in Germany in the 1870s and spreading quickly across industrialized nations, electric trains replaced steam-powered locomotives by offering quieter, faster, and more efficient transit. With the development of overhead lines and third-rail systems, electric trains became the backbone of mass public transportation, enabling the rapid expansion of cities. Electrical engineers contributed by designing motors, braking systems, control units, and power infrastructure, all essential to building safe and scalable electric railway networks.

                Japan adopted electric railways early on, with Tokyo opening its first electric tram line in 1903. Since then, Tokyo has evolved into one of the most rail-connected cities in the world. The Tokyo Metro and JR East systems operate a vast web of electric trains, used by millions of commuters daily. A prominent example is the Yamanote Line, a loop line that connects Tokyoâ€™s central districts and is powered entirely by electricity. High-speed electric trains like the Shinkansen also connect Tokyo with other major cities, thanks to innovations in linear motor and magnetic levitation technologies. The city's dependency on efficient electric rail transport is a direct outcome of electrical engineering advancements.
