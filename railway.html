        <h2>Railway System background information</h2>
        <div class="info-card">
            <p>
                The railway system has been a cornerstone of Japan’s transportation network since the late 19th century. The first railway line opened in 1872, connecting Tokyo and Yokohama, marking the beginning of rapid modernization in Japan. Early trains were steam-powered, but with technological advances, electric trains soon became the standard, offering faster, cleaner, and more efficient transit. Over time, innovations such as the introduction of the Shinkansen—Japan’s famous bullet train—in the 1960s revolutionized high-speed rail travel. These developments have allowed the railway system to efficiently handle millions of passengers daily, making it one of the busiest and most reliable networks in the world.

            <p>
                Tokyo’s railway system has played a vital role in shaping the city’s urban landscape and economic growth. The extensive network of subway lines, commuter trains, and regional rail services connects every corner of the metropolitan area, enabling easy access to business districts, residential neighborhoods, and cultural hubs. This connectivity has supported Tokyo’s rapid population growth and urban sprawl, allowing the city to expand sustainably despite limited land availability. Moreover, the railway’s punctuality, safety, and frequency have made it the preferred mode of transportation for millions of commuters. The integration of cutting-edge technology, such as automated train operations and smart ticketing systems, continues to enhance the efficiency and convenience of Tokyo’s railways, ensuring they remain central to the city’s future development.
